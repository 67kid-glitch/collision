# COLLISION: THE GAME FIGHTS BACK

A chaotic 3D crossover action game where multiple game universes collide and all characters believe this is THEIR game.

The game starts as chaos, accidentally becomes a story, and ends with the game itself turning against the player.

Inspired by:
- Super Smash Bros Ultimate (World of Light)
- Super Mario Odyssey
- Breath of the Wild
- Meta games that break themselves

This project is intentionally engine-agnostic.
No Unity. No Unreal. No Godot.

This repository contains:
- Full game design
- Systems logic
- World structure
- Character rules
- Boss logic

The game is designed to be absurdly long, speedrun-friendly, and unhinged.
